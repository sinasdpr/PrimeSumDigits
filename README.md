# Sum of Digits Prime Numbers

This project finds numbers within a given range where the sum of their digits is a **prime number**.

## Description

This project implements an algorithm that iterates through all numbers in a given range. For each number, the program calculates the sum of its digits and checks whether the result is a **prime number**. If the condition is met, the number is printed along with its digit sum. At the end, the total count of such numbers is displayed.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs two numbers (min and max) as the range.
2. The program iterates through all numbers in that range.
3. For each number:
   - It calculates the sum of its digits.
   - If the sum is a **prime number**, the number is printed.
4. Finally, the program prints the **total count** of such numbers.

## Example

### Input

```
100 200
```

### Output

```
101 = 2
102 = 3
104 = 5
106 = 7
110 = 2
...
tedad adad: 37
```

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```
